    <h1>My name is Andrew Luke</h1>
    <h2>I also go by Drew</h2>
    <p>I absolutely LOVE riding motorcycles, this is a picture of me on a 2,000 mile ride this summer with my best
        friend Kirk. We rode our motorcycles all around the mountains of Colorado, it was amazing.</p>

    <p>I am really excited for this class. If I were to be 110% honest though I am still a little bit confused about
        what this class is actually going to be about. But I am excited for the class and hope to learn lots. I really
        enjoy programming and Dr. Anderson's class last semester was my favorite so I know I will enjoy this class a
        lot. I am also excited to learn from Prof. Hilton again this semester.</p>

        <p>My top three jobs are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Anything to do with a small business</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I love the idea of working in a small start up and using all of my skills wherever they are
                    necessary instead of being stuck in one specific job role</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Project/Program Manager</li>
            <li>Database Administrator</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disclaimer: I really feel like I have no idea what possibilities are out there for me, I am just excited to
            get into the industry and see where it takes me</p>
